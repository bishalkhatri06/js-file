        - variables are the building blocks of any programming language.
        - variables can be used to store reusable values.
        - these values can be anything such as number, boolean, string, and even a value return from a function.
        - variable can be declare either by using var, let or const.
        - while naming the variable, there are some basic rules:
            -> can only begin with a letter, underscore(_)or $symbol
            -> these are case sensitive
            -> it can contain letters, numbers, underscore, $ symbol.
            -> it cannot be js built-in keywords and methods
